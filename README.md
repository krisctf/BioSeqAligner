![BioSeqAligner Logo](https://example.com/bioseqaligner-logo.png)

BioSeqAligner is a versatile bioinformatics tool for sequence alignment and analysis. It offers a wide range of features for both DNA and protein sequence analysis, including pairwise alignment, multiple sequence alignment, structural alignment, sequence translation, and more.

## Features

- **Pairwise Alignment:** Perform pairwise sequence alignments using various algorithms like Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch.

- **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA):** Conduct multiple sequence alignments using progressive and iterative methods.

- **Structural Alignment:** Explore structural alignment techniques, including homology modeling and protein docking.

- **Sequence Translation:** Translate DNA sequences into proteins to study gene expression.

- **Extensive Utilities:** Utilize a suite of utilities for sequence similarity calculations, file I/O, data preprocessing, and data visualization.
